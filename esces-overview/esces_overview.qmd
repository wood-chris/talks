## How it started!

::: {.fragment}
 - NERC ASTC calls
    - Relatively small amounts of funding to run relevant training courses for NERC-domain researchers (max of £60k per submission)
    - Most funded bids are for single, high-cost, summer-school-style courses
    - We realised there was a gap in courses covering scientific computing skills 
:::

::: {.fragment}
 - Essential Scientific Computing Skills for Environmental Scientists (ESCES) was born:
    - Training for non-computational environmental and life scientists
    - Fits a skills gap that UKRI has acknowledged for several years exists
    - Build upon the well tested material of The Carpentries 
      - Fork the lessons and modify many of the examples to make them more environmental focussed: try to reduce cognitive load 
:::

## ESCES1

::: {.fragment}
  - June 2022 - May 2023
  - Carpentries material forked and modifed
  - 6 courses planned:
    - 2 each of a "beginner" (Bash, Python & Numpy, git) and "intermediate" (more Bash, "Python best practices", data analysis using Pandas) course

       <!-- - assuming knowledge of Python when teaching Pandas means we can cover more material, including a brand new geospatial episode we wrote specifically -->
:::

::: {.fragment}
- funding for travel and accommodation so that PhD students don't need to use their RTSG
    - these kinds of skills *are* important, but not as important as attending a conference or buying lab consumables...  
  - ring-fenced budget for DEI <!-- e.g. paying for caring so parents can attend full day courses they might not otherwise be able to -->
  - 180 places; 232 registrations 
  - panel score: 7
:::

## It continued: ESCES2

::: {.fragment}
 
 <!-- - August 2023 - July 2024 -->

 - introduced an advanced course covering distributed data analysis using Spark on JASMIN, basic parallelisation using GNU Parallel and numba
 - expanded courses to three locations (added Liverpool); 4 beginner courses; 3 intermediate courses; 2 advanced courses
 - 3 "bring your own data" days (one at each level, in each location) <!-- [but, had an underspend so added an extra BYOD day to final in-person course] -->
 - 240 total places across all 9 courses (limit because of ~~bug~~ _feature_ in Je-S Studentship Application form...); 433 registrations
 - panel score: 8
:::

## ...and again: ESCES3

::: {.fragment}

 <!-- - April 2025 - April 2026  -->

 - basically a repeat of ESCES2
 - intermediate online course was run as over 4 half day sessions  <!-- (Monday; Tuesday; Monday; Tuesday) with a later start; seems to have been well received; less intense for both instuctors and learners -->
 - advanced in-person course is ~200% oversubscribed <!-- (we have enough underspend that we're intending to run another course) -->
 - 240 total places across all 9 courses; 308 registrations to date (6 courses done so far)
 - panel score: 9
:::

## Success?

::: {.fragment}
- Panel scores increased for each grant; feedback was generally very positive
- Attendees are encouraged to complete the Carpentries pre- and post-workshop surveys for each course
  - allows us to get some metrics that The Carpenties calculates, including NPS (-100<NPS<+100; a good course is >50; an excellent course is >75)
  - we have had one course that was 92(!); all courses above 50
:::

::: {.fragment}
- we also ask them to complete "post-it note feedback" and a more generic very short post-course survey
- Significant number of attendees return (55 attendees of a novice course have signed up to an intermediate course)
- panel only funded one computational training course in 2025/6 (in previous rounds University of Manchester had funding to run Intermediate Software Development; they were unsucessful this year)

## What attendees have said about the courses

Since I'm quiet and unassuming, and not at all narcissistic, this is the _most_ modest feedback... :) 

::: {.fragment}

 <!-- > It was a wonderful course! Really enjoy it! I learned a lot-Thank you sooo much -->
 
 > I've learned more than I ever have, thank you!
 
 > Andrew is a great teacher. Really good at the conceptual framework stuff. Analogies and diagrams v. useful

 > Geospatial -> interactive maps will be SUPER useful for my data! Was really interesting!
:::

##

 > Great content :) It is nice to learn the 'official' way of doing things instead of my dodgy stack overflow accumulated knowledge. Also good to know why things are the way they are. I now want to go and streamline my code to tidy it up and be nicer
 
 > courses taught by both Andrew & Chris was great and they were both very interactive. Nice experience :) Thank you!

 > Very good instructions and the help from the PhD students was great

 > Chris is really passionate & very good in teaching the python code. The lecture is really helpful and useful

 > This course is great! I always thought supercomputers were hard + not for me



## Some thoughts

 - wide range of organisations represented by attendees, including public sector (e.g. SEPA, UKHO) and NGO (e.g. National Trust)
   - wouldn't normally have access to this kind of course
 - can never please everyone! Even with making examples environmental some feedback was they didn't understand the context
 - good retention rate for courses, even for online
 - but: conversion of initial registrations to attendee is only ~50%
 - only get 100% cash value (including staff costs), not 80% fEC - in reality these are about equivalent but there are still extra hoops to jump through
 - compared with other ASTC courses still seems very good value per attendee
 - future funding opportunities? ASTC seems to have been quietly dropped for now
 - potential bigger collaboration with University of Manchester
 - I've been doing all admin + sorting out registrations, which has been fairly time consuming for nearly 1000 registrations...

## tl;dr

(if you've been reading your emails for the last 10 mins)

 - 3 years of NERC training: total of £156,745
 - reduce cognitive load by using environmental examples
 - beginner, intermediate, and advanced courses - most of which built on existing Carpentries material
 - 24 courses
  - 660 places
  - 973 registrants 
  - 480 actual attendees to date
 - well received by attendees and ASTC review panels
 - future courses dependent on some sort of funding
